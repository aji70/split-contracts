//! StellarSplit — on-chain invoice & payment splitting contract.
//!
//! Allows a creator to define an invoice with multiple recipients and amounts.
//! Payers contribute funds; once fully funded the contract auto-routes USDC to
//! each recipient. If the deadline passes unfunded, payers are refunded.
